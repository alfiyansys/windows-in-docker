# WIND - Windows in Docker

Browser > VNC > Docker > Arch > KVM > Windows

Oh, and it uses LXD too.

## WHY?

1) I use Arch btw

2) Got this idea at 3AM

## Disclaimer

This image is rebuilt from CI every 24 hours.

I have no time to test if Arch breaks something randomly, please file an issue.

Works on my machine â„¢.
